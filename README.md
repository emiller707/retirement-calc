# retirement-calc

The first version of this basic retirement calculator takes in 5 variables: current investment amount, net income, investment rate, year term, and user expected rate of return to produce an estimate of how much money one can have by the time they wish to retire.

I created this program because I've found other retirement calculators online to have less user input for expected rate of return, possibility of retiring early, or expected income increase over time.
